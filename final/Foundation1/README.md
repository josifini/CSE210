Explanation 

Video and Comment Classes: These classes are designed to encapsulate the properties and behaviors of videos and comments, respectively.
Creating and Adding Comments: In the main program, we create Video objects, add Comment objects to them, and then store them in a list.
Displaying Information: We iterate over each Video object in the list, displaying its details and the comments associated with it.
This program effectively demonstrates how to manage and display information about YouTube videos and their comments, following the principles of object-oriented programming. Remember, this program is a simulation and does not interact with YouTube's actual data.
